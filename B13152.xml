         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And for the more due and just execution of the Premisses, His Majestie by His said Letters Patents, hath authorized the Bailiffs, Wardens, and Assistants of the Weavers of <hi>London,</hi> from time to time to appoint meet persons skilfull in the said Art of Weaving, to view and search all Silks and Stuffs of what breadth soever made, of forrain, or part forrain Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, by any person or persons in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales;</hi> and upon due triall had of the said Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures (they being found of just breadths, and made of right and unfalsified Materials, and being truly Wrought and Woven, to Seal with the severall Stamps or Seals hereafter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, appointed for that purpose, (which His Majestie commands that none presume to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit:) all such Stuffs (above a quarter of a yard broad) as they shall finde good and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable, and to reject and forbear to Seal the contrary, but to seize and take them into their custody to be defaced or destroyed, and the Makers thereof to be further punished according to their offences.</p>
            <p>Wherefore His Majestie doth hereby further straitly charge and command, that all Tishews, Gold or Silver Stuffs, and all other Silks and Stuffs (above one quarter of a yard broad) to be made of forrain, or part forrain Materials, within the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> or within five miles of either of them, after the Feast day of <hi>All Saints</hi> next ensuing, shall be brought to the common Hall of the said Company of Weavers within the City of <hi>London,</hi> to be there Viewed, Searched, and Sealed by the sworn Officer or Officers appointed, and to be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that behalf, without any Fee to be taken for the same; And that all such other of the said Stuffs as shall be Made, or Wrought in any other parts or places of the Realm of <hi>England</hi>

            <p>And His Majestie doth also straitly charge and command, that no person or persons whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from and after the said Feast day of <hi>All Saints</hi> next coming, shall Buy, Sell, or expose to sale any peece or parcell of Tishews, Gold and Silver Stuffes, or other Silks or Stuffs (above a quarter of a yard broad) made of forrain, or part forrain Materials, before the same shall be Sealed, as aforesaid, upon pain of the losse and forfeiture of the same Silks or Stuffs so sold or put to sale, before they shall be so Sealed. And for reforming a great abuse now used in the making of Ribands and Laces, by the help of an Engine called a great Loom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one person alone will make as much work (though in a false and deceitfull manner) as ten persons can do in single Looms in the like time, to the hinderance and undoing of many of His Majesties people of the said Trade; His Majestie therefore doth charge and command, That no person or persons whatsoever, from and after the Feast of the Birth of Our Lord God next coming, shall work in, use, or exercise any such Frame or Engine, called A great Loom, or any other Frame or Engine, wherein there shall be made or wrought any more Laces or Ribands of any sort then only one at one and the same time, upon pain of His Majesties heavy displeasure, and such punishments as shall be meet to be inflicted upon the Offenders for their contempts herein: And that no person or persons, shall privately, or by way of Hawking, carry any Silks, or Stuffs, Garters, Ribands, Laces, or other Manufactures made of forrain, or part forrain Materials, broad or narrow, to private mens houses, or Innes, within the Cities of <hi>London</hi> &amp; <hi>Westminster,</hi> or the Suburbs or Liberties of the same, to vend or put to sale, nor shall proffer the same to sale to people as they passe in the Streets, upon pain of the losse and forfeiture of all such Manufactures as shall be so offered to sale, by the way of Hawking, as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And for the better effecting of His Majesties Royall intentions in the Premisses, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie doth expresly will, require, and command, That all such persons as now do, or hereafter shall use the Trade of Weaving within <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Southwark,</hi> and the Liberties thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or which shall be free of other Companies of <hi>London,</hi> and not of the Guild of Weavers, shall according to severall Orders of the Court of Lord Maior and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> which by Acts of State were after confirmed, be forthwith and from time to time translated to the said Company of Weavers, and be and continue subject to their lawfull Ordinances. And as concerning the present Tradesmen and Artificers in the Art of Weaving, of forrain, or part forrain Materials, His Majestie hath by His said Letters Patents ordained and declared, That the said Bailiffs, Wardens, and Assistants shall and may receive and admit into the said Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration to exercise the said Trade, such competent number of fit persons, as to them in their discretions shall seem meet and convenient, being naturall born Subjects, Denizens, or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who have exercised the said Trade here one whole yeer at the least, before the date of the said Letters Patents, and are conformable to the Laws of the Realm, and Constitutions of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And that from and after two yeers next following, they shall not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into the said Corporation, any persons to exercise the said Trade of Weaving of forrain, or part forrain Materials, unlesse he or they have served seven yeers to the said Trade, within the said Corporation. And to this His Majesties declaration of His Royall will and pleasur
<pb facs="tcp:188385:4"/>the Premisses (tending to the common good of His Subjects) His Majestie requireth all due confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of all such whom it shall concern, upon pain of His Majesties high displeasure, and as they will answer for their neglects or contempts herein. And to the end that it may be certainly known what Silks or Stuffs made in forrain parts, shall from time to time be imported into the Kingdom, And whether the same shall be made and wrought of their true breadths, and right Materials, according to His Majesties directions for those that shall be made here, His Majesties pleasure is to appoint a speciall Officer for Searching and Sealing of all such Silks and Stuffs, as from the said Feast of <hi>All Saints</hi> next shall be imported into the Realm of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> from forrain parts.</p>
            <p>And His Majestie doth therefore straitly charge and command, That every Merchant and other person and persons whatsoever, which shall after the said Feast of <hi>All Saints</hi> next, import, or bring, or cause to be imported, or brought into this His Majesties Realm, or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> any Tishews, Gold or Silver Stuffs, Velvets, Sattins, Plushes, Damasks, or other Stuffs whatsoever, do cause the same to be viewed and Sealed by the said Officer or His Deputy, before such time as the said Stuffs, or any of them, shall be put to sale, upon pain of the seizure and forfeiture of the same, and such other penalties and punishments as shall be meet to be inflicted for their contempts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And His Majestie being informed of a great deceit now used in the mixing of Worsted with Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geran Yarn in Tamets, Parragons, and other like Stuffs, doth therefore hereby further charge and command, That from and after the Feast of the Birth of Our Lord God next coming, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or persons whatsoever, shall Make or Weave within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> nor shall import into the same from forrain parts, any Tamets, Parragons, or other Stuffs made of Grogeran Yarn, wherin there shall be Woven or mixed any Worsted whatsoever, upon pain of the seizure and forfeiture of the same, and such other penalties and punishments as shall be meet to be inflicted for their contempts herein. And His Majestie doth likewise will and require all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of Peace, Maiors, Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Constables, Headboroughs, Tithingmen, and other His Officers and Ministers to whom it shall appertain, That they and every of them from time to time hereafter, without excuse or delay, be favouring, aiding, and assisting to the said Company of Weavers of <hi>London,</hi> their Deputies and Searchers, in the due execution of all or any the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses when they shall be thereunto required, as they will answer the contrary at their perils.</p>
